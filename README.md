## Userland Application

Welcome to userland application ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰

Userland appilication is a self-management application that has the following features:

- Registration
- Activation email
- Forget and reset password
- Login
- Manage basic information
- Manage profile picture
- Change email
- Change password
- Manage session
- Manage refresh token
- Manage access token
- Log user login information (using kafka)

## Code Structure

This project used onion model architecture as the guidline to structure the code. This approach was chosen

## Database schema

Below is how the database schema looks like

![Userland Diagram.drawio](assets/img/Userland Diagram.drawio.png)

This application is formed from three entities and the database used is postgreSql. Below is the brief explanation for each entity.

1. Person entity

   This entity is used to store basic information about the user. This entity has a zero to many relationship with session entity. It means that one user might have zero or more session because user when user have not logged in, user won't have any session. Otherwise, when user logged in, that information will be stored to session table. This entity also has one to many relationship with user_password entity. It means that one user can have one or more password. Below is the postgreSql script for person entity:

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS "Person"{
	"id" UUID NOT NULL,
	"fullname" VARCHAR (128) NOT NULL,
	"password" VARCHAR (128) NOT NULL,
	"email" VARCHAR (128) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
	"location" VARCHAR (256),
	"bio" VARCHAR (256),
	"web" VARCHAR(128),
	"picture" VARCHAR (128),
	"created_at" TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
	"is_active" BOOLEAN NOT NULL,
	PRIMARY KEY ("id")
} WITHOUT OIDS;
```

2. Session entity

   This entity is used to store user login information. This information includes the session id, time when user login, time when user refresh the session, user' ip address, user device as well as used id. This entity has a zero to many relationship with person entity as describe above. One user might have zero to many session and that session is only related to the particular person. Below is the postgreSql script for session entity:

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS "Session"{
	"id" UUID NOT NULL,
	"user_id" UUID NOT NULL,
	"ip_addres" VARCHAR (16) NOT NULL,
	"created_at" TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
	"updated_at" TIMESTAMP,
	"device" VARCHAR (20) NOT NULL,
	PRIMARY KEY ("id"),
	CONSTRAINT "fk_user_id" FOREIGN KEY ("user_id") REFERENCES "Person" ("id") ON DELETE CASCADE ON UPDATE CASCADE
} WITHOUT OIDS;
```

3. User_password entity

   This entity is used to store information all the user' password that they have used in the system. This entity is made because of the requirement where user cannot change their password to the last three passwords that they have used. This entity has a one to many relationship with person entity. It means that one person can have one or more passwords as the user changing their password. Below is the postgreSql script for user_password entity:

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS "User_password"{
	"id" UUID NOT NULL,
	"password" VARCHAR (128) NOT NULL,
	"created_at" TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
	CONSTRAINT "fk_id" FOREIGN KEY ("id") REFERENCES "Person" ("id") ON DELETE CASCADE ON UPDATE CASCADE
} WITHOUT OIDS;
```

4. Login_audit entity

   This entity is used to store user login information. This entity is made as an excercise to use kafka. When user logged in, user information about username (session id), ip_address as well as the login time will be published by the kafka. The subscriber is running using goroutine to always listen to any data that kafka publish and if there is data published, that data will be stored to this login_audit table. This entity has a one to many relationship with person entity. It means that one person can have one or more login information as the user login to the system. Below is the postgreSql script for login_audit entity:

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS "Login_audit"{
	"username" UUID NOT NULL,
	"ip_address" VARCHAR (16) NOT NULL,
	"created_at" TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
	CONSTRAINT "fk_username" FOREIGN KEY ("username") REFERENCES "Person" ("id") ON DELETE CASCADE ON UPDATE CASCADE
} WITHOUT OIDS;
```

## Redis Schema

Redis was used in this application to store data that has expiration time such as the email verification code, access token as well as refresh token. Below is the brief explanation for each of the data.

1. Email_ver_code schema

   ![email_ver_code](assets/img/email_ver_code.png)

   For this email verification code schema, string data structure was used. The key for this schema is email and the value for this schema is the email verification code. This data will be stored for only 60 seconds. Below is the redis script for this schema:

   To store data :

```
SETEX example@gmail.com 60 123456
```

â€‹ To get data :

```
GET example@gmail.com
```

2. Access token schema

   ![access_token](assets/img/access_token.png)

   For this access token schema, string data structure was used. The key for this schema is access_token:jti and the value for this schema is user_id. This data will be stored for 30 minutes. Below is the redis script for this schema:

   To store data :

```
SETEX access_token:{jwt id} 1800 {user_id}
```

â€‹ To get data :

```
GET access_token:{jwt id}
```

3. Refresh token schema

   ![refresh_token](assets/img/refresh_token.png)

   For this refresh token schema, string sata structure was used. The key for this schema is refresh_token:jti and the value for this schema is user_id. This data will be stored for 7 days. Below is the redis script for this schema:

   To store data :

```
SETEX refresh_token:{jwt id} 604800 {user_id}
```

â€‹ To get data :

```
GET refresh_token:{jwt id}
```

## To run the Program

1. Make sure docker is installed on your local
2. Run the docker
3. Create a .env file based on the .env.example file
4. Run the following command

```
docker-compose up
```

5. The server is listening to localhost:8080
